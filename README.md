## How MySQL Works üîç

MySQL operates on a client-server model. The client sends requests to the server, which processes the queries and returns the results. The server interacts with a database to fetch, update, or delete data. MySQL stores the data in tables, which consist of rows and columns, and these tables are used to represent relationships between different entities.

- **Database**: A collection of related data.
- **Table**: A structure within a database to store data in rows and columns.
- **Rows**: Each row represents a record in the table.
- **Columns**: Columns define the type of data stored in the table (e.g., text, numbers, dates).
