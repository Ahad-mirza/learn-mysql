## Overview of WHERE Clause

The `WHERE` clause in SQL is used to filter records that meet a certain condition. It helps narrow down the data that is returned by a query by specifying which rows should be selected based on a given condition.

### General Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```


## How to Use the WHERE Clause

You can use the `WHERE` clause to filter rows based on a variety of conditions. The condition in the `WHERE` clause can involve comparisons like `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `<>`, and more. You can also combine multiple conditions using logical operators like `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`.

## Benefits of Using WHERE
- Precision: It allows you to filter data based on specific criteria, ensuring that only relevant data is retrieved.
- Performance: Filtering data reduces the amount of data returned from the database, leading to improved performance.
- Customization: It allows you to customize queries to meet specific needs by applying conditions based on column values.

### Example
Below is an example query that demonstrates the use of the WHERE clause:

```sql
Copy code
USE sql_store;
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE customer_id > 4;
```
### Explanation of Example:
In the above query:

- We are selecting all columns `(*)` from the orders table.
- The `WHERE clause` filters the rows, returning only those where the customer_id is greater than 4.
This query helps retrieve only the orders made by customers with an ID greater than 4, which is useful if you want to analyze data for specific customers or groups.
