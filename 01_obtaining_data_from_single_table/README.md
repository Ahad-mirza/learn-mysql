## What is the SELECT Statement? 📝

The `SELECT` statement in MySQL is used to query the database and retrieve data from one or more tables. It allows you to specify the columns you want to retrieve, and it can include various conditions to filter, sort, and group the data. The `SELECT` statement is one of the most commonly used commands in SQL.

### General Purpose:
- To retrieve data from a database.
- To perform filtering, sorting, and grouping on the retrieved data.

## Purpose of SELECT Clause 🎯

The `SELECT` clause is the core part of the SQL query used to define what data you want to retrieve. It specifies the columns that should be included in the result set.

- **Selecting All Columns**: You can use the asterisk (`*`) to select all columns from a table.
- **Selecting Specific Columns**: You can list the specific columns you want by naming them.

For example:
- `SELECT * FROM employees;`  
  This selects all columns from the `employees` table.
- `SELECT name, salary FROM employees;`  
  This selects only the `name` and `salary` columns from the `employees` table.

The `SELECT` clause is essential for defining the data you need from a database.

## Purpose of WHERE Clause 🔍

The `WHERE` clause is used to filter the data retrieved by the `SELECT` statement based on specific conditions. It allows you to define criteria that must be met for a record to be included in the result set.

### Key Points:
- **Filters data**: The `WHERE` clause restricts the data by applying conditions.
- **Conditions**: Conditions in the `WHERE` clause can involve comparisons like `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `<>`, and more.
- **Combining Conditions**: You can combine multiple conditions using logical operators like `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`.

For example:
- `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;`  
  This retrieves all employees whose salary is greater than 50,000.
- `SELECT name, age FROM employees WHERE age BETWEEN 30 AND 40;`  
  This retrieves the names and ages of employees who are between 30 and 40 years old.

The `WHERE` clause helps to narrow down the results to match specific criteria, improving query efficiency and relevance.

## Example of SELECT with WHERE Clause 💻

Here's an example of how the `SELECT` statement and `WHERE` clause work together:

- **Scenario**: You want to retrieve the names and salaries of employees who earn more than 50,000.

### Query:
```sql
SELECT name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
```

# Explanation:

- `SELECT name, salary`: This part specifies that you want to retrieve the `name` and `salary` columns.
- `FROM employees`: This specifies the table (`employees`) from which to retrieve the data.
- `WHERE salary > 50000`: The `WHERE` clause filters the data to include only those employees with a salary greater than 50,000.

This query would return the list of employee names and their salaries, but only for those employees who meet the condition of having a salary greater than 50,000.

## In summary:

- The `SELECT` clause is used to specify what data you want to retrieve.
- The `WHERE` clause is used to filter the data based on specific conditions, allowing you to narrow down the results.
